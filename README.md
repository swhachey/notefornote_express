### USAGE
Once you visit the deployed site, you'll be greeted at our welcome page. Click the button to start taking notes. You will be taken to the notes page where there are two fields, title and body. You can title you note and fill out the body text. Then the save button should appear in the navbar. Click that to save your note on the left side. If you want to erase the text in the note form, click the pen in the corner to start a  new note. Still working on delte button functionality.
